# Payment wallet Application
It is built to support all the functionality related to managing a online payment wallet application for XYZ bank. We will discuss each aspect of this project in detail for enhanced understanding. The Payment wallet Application project is designed in Spring Boot and Hibernate along with the source code. Customers will be able to park their money in the wallet , pay different bills using this wallet and customers should be able to connect bank account with this payment wallet and add money.  On the other hand, Application should allow customers to check the balance, deposit money etc.

we have designed a cab Booking System project in spring boot & hibernate, which has three main roles i.e. Admin and User. Admin is the primary user and can add/remove/update any details related to the system. Admin can manage registered users and drivers. Admin can Add/Remove/Update cab and their details from the system. Admin can also categorize taxis accordingly. Admin will be responsible for keeping a check on all the bookings done by users. Admin can View/Confirm/Cancel bookings done by users. Admin can check and manage the availability of cab and also, keep a track of the status of all the cab that are engaged.

Admin can set/update prices and charges of the taxi rides. Admin can manage the drivers and their details.

On the other hand, users can register. Users can search and view the taxis available. Users can search taxis by entering the location.

Admin can maintain a database of drivers. Drivers have to register on the portal. Drivers will be able to see the booking done by users and details of users like name, source, and destination location.
